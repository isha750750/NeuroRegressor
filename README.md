# NeuroRegressor
This project demonstrates how a simple neural network can learn a linear relationship (y = 3x₁ + 4x₂) using feedforward and backpropagation. It includes activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU), weight updates, error tracking, and visualizations of prediction and error trends over 20 training epochs.
